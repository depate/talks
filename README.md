### Create beautiful web presentations

With [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md), a markdown-revealjs parser, one can generate the output with:
`reveal-md input.md`. Optionally introduce the `-w`flag to set reveal-md in `·∫Åatch mode`. So you can work on the markdown input file while reveal-md regocnises changes and recompiles automagically after saving the file.

For further instructions on how to install reveal-md to your computer please have a look at [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md).
