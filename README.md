Repository about talks that I gave.

### Create beautiful web presentations
#### Basic Usage 
With [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md), a markdown-revealjs parser, one can generate the output with:

`reveal-md input.md`.

This also works with remote markdown files, e.g.:

`reveal-md https://github.com/depate/talks/blob/master/ejkw2018/2018_09_30_alternativen_zu_google.md`

#### Automated generation while editing

Optionally introduce the `-w`flag to set reveal-md in `ẁatch mode`. So you can work on the markdown input file while reveal-md regocnises changes and recompiles automagically after saving the file.


#### Installation instructions

For further instructions on how to install reveal-md to your computer please have a look at [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md).
This focuses on commandline usage.
